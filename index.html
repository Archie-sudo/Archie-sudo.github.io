      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p><strong>Live or Die. Eat or Get Eaten: The Brutal Reality of Life</strong> is more than a book. It is a summons for anyone unwilling to linger in mediocrity, a blueprint for those who feel in their bones that they were meant to dominate their space. It is part warning, part manifesto, part battlefield strategy for life as it is, not as we wish it to be.</p>

      <p>In the tradition of Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and Hemingway, this book dissects the forces that shape power, influence, and survival. Life does not hand out victories, and the line between triumph and being forgotten is thinner than we like to admit. While others hesitate, you must act. While others sleep, you must build. Rise fully or be replaced, because the world has no patience for the idle. As Marcus Aurelius wrote, obstacles are not hindrances, they are the path itself.</p>

      <p>This book hands you the tools you were never taught but always needed. You will learn how to craft habits that make excellence inevitable. You will develop focus so precise it feels surgical. You will acquire strategies to bend but never break under pressure. You will understand the economics of time, the architecture of attention, and the subtle predator dynamics that shape every decision you make. Technology, psychology, distraction, and manipulation will no longer control you. You will learn to turn the table and make them work for you instead.</p>

      <p>Living is never comfortable. It is exacting, demanding, and frequently painful. Eating is not indulgence, it is mastery. It is claiming your career, your calling, your craft, and your God-given ground, and expanding it relentlessly. To die without leaving a mark and to be consumed by circumstance is the default state. This book ensures you will not remain default. You will leave a footprint. You will rise. You will eat where others starve.</p>

      <p><strong>Live or Die. Eat or Get Eaten</strong> is your strategy guide, your wake-up call, your invitation to step fully armed into the arena of life. Read it, absorb it, apply it, or accept that the world will move past you without a backward glance.</p>

         <h2>About William Otakwa – The Archetypal Author</h2>
<p>William Otakwa is a Tech Enthusiast, Certified Pentester with a focus on Red Teaming, and a Community Health Professional who operates where technology, human behavior, and societal systems converge. As the author of <em>Live or Die. Eat or Get Eaten</em>, he embodies the rare ability to merge analytical precision with unflinching insight, crafting work that is both technically rigorous and profoundly human.</p>

<p>Educated at Alliance High School and later at Kenyatta University, William’s academic journey honed his intellectual edge and prepared him for a career defined by depth and versatility. These institutions, long recognized for producing leaders, cultivated in him the discipline of excellence and the hunger for mastery; qualities that permeate his professional path and literary voice.</p>

<p>In the field of cybersecurity, William has made a practice of dissecting complex systems, uncovering vulnerabilities, and anticipating threats before they emerge. His work extends beyond code and networks; it touches the core of human systems and decision-making. By combining technical expertise with psychological understanding, he exposes the unseen mechanics that drive both strength and collapse in modern structures. His clarity transforms theory into action, vision into dominance, and challenges into opportunities.</p>

<p>Yet William is more than a strategist and practitioner. At heart, he is a storyteller. His writing draws from cybersecurity, psychology, and lived experience to reveal the forces that quietly shape our existence. Through his work, he speaks to those unwilling to settle for mediocrity; individuals determined to rise, claim their space, and master their realities with awareness and intent.</p>

<p>Whether encountered through his research, his ethical hacking exploits, or the sharp resonance of his literary voice, William’s mission remains constant: to equip readers and professionals with the tools and mindset required to thrive in an era built to challenge, distract, and consume the unprepared. He writes with urgency and conviction, standing at the intersection of systems, psychology, and raw truth, offering a perspective that is at once prophetic, unyielding, and deeply necessary for the age we live in.</p>
